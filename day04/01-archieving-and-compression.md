# Archiving and Compression

Archiving and compression are crucial techniques for managing file sizes and optimizing network transfers. By compressing files, we reduce the bandwidth needed to transfer them; by archiving, we bundle multiple files into a single package for convenient transport or backup.

## Benefits of Archiving and Compression
