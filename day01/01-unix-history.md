# A Brief History of UNIX and Linux

## 1957: Bell Labs’ Need for an Operating System
Bell Labs found they needed an operating system for their computer center, which was running various batch jobs.

## 1965: Multics (Multiplexed Information and Computing Service)
- Bell Labs adopted third-generation computer equipment and decided to join forces with General Electric (GE) and MIT to create **Multics**.  
- **General Electric (GE)** was owned by *Thomas Alva Edison*.  
- **MIT** is a well-known research university.  
- The **Multics project** grew large and complex. Eventually, Bell Labs became frustrated with its size and complexity, and the project was declared a failure.  
- The Multics code was ultimately kept at MIT.

## The Shift to UNICS
- After **Multics** was withdrawn, **Ken Thompson** and **Dennis Ritchie** needed to rewrite an operating system for the **DEC PDP-7** (Programmed Data Processor with 4K memory for user programs).  
- The result was a system called **UNICS** (*UNiplexed Information and Computing Service*), which was an improved version of Multics.

## 1972: From ‘B’ to ‘C’, and UNICS Becomes UNIX
- In 1972, **Dennis Ritchie** rewrote the language **B** into **C**.  
- **UNICS** was subsequently rewritten in **C**, becoming **UNIX**.  
- This made UNIX **portable software**, requiring only a small amount of machine-dependent code to be replaced when porting UNIX to other computing platforms.  
- Thus, UNIX became a hardware-independent OS and was kept at MIT.

## UNIX Variants
Different organizations started customizing UNIX to run on their systems:
- **HP** – *HP-UX*  
- **IBM** – *AIX*  
- **SUN** – *Solaris*  

However, **UNIX** itself was far more expensive, and the high pricing kept many small PC users away.

## Andrew S. Tanenbaum and MINIX
- **Andrew S. Tanenbaum**, a US-born Dutch professor, wanted to teach his students the inner workings of a real operating system.  
- **MINIX** was designed to run on the Intel 8086 microprocessors.  
- The first version of MINIX was written for the mainstream IBM PC and compatible personal computers.

## 1991: The Birth of Linux
- In 1991, **Linus Torvalds** from MIT converted MINIX to a **Monolithic kernel** using Python, C, and Perl for faster processing.  
- This marked the birth of **Linux**.  
- **Linux** is a high-performance and completely free, Unix-like operating system that is suitable for use on a wide range of computers and other products.
